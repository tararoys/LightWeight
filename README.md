LightWeight
===========

World's Dumbest HTML, SVG, and Plaintext Editor

 I injured my hand from typing too much. Sadly,  I wanted to draw. I was using the  speech recognition software Dragon Dictate, which has some pretty powerful voice driven mousing tools,  although it's about 10 times slower than using an actual mouse. So I tried using Inkscape.   It took me well over 50 mouse clicks to do what I wanted.
 
 I'm a programmer. There had to be a better way.  I know how to write SVG files by hand. What I wanted was to write an SVG file by hand  (or rather by voice),  but see immediately the changes that were being made to the image without having to switch windows.  Inkscape  lets you do that in 50 clicks and makes you switch to this hideous svg editor that hides half your screen. I wanted to do it with one button push.
 
 So I wrote LightWeight.   You type stuff into the text box. Every time you press the space bar, takes the stuff in the text box and displayed it to the left of the text box. This is an editor so dumb that it's not even specifically  for editing SVGs.  you can write HTML, CSS, and probably JavaScript too,  and if it is valid,  lightweight will show it to you.
  
  If it's not valid, lightweight will probably show you nothing, and may even break.
